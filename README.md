## How the Stratis.Guru Lottery Works ?
For now it's a very simple process, you make a deposit with the amount that you want, and you put your nickname/withdraw address, when the lotery countdown end, I manually choose a winner by using random.org (this system will change in the future)
All $STRAT coins are stored in cold wallet, by using an xpub.
